                      <p className="mt-3">
                        Covid-19 testing is very important and the only way we
                        can confirm if you have COVID-19. Testing helps people
                        determine if they are infected regardless of whether
                        they have symptoms or not. Testing helps reduce the
                        spread of the virus. When someone tests positive for
                        COVID-19, they can be isolated at home or, if needed, in
                        a hospital. Taking testing measures to prevent the
                        spread of infection will be one of the most effective
                        strategies for helping Bermuda and the world get us
                        safely back to work and school and help the economy.
                        Testing is important to protect your family, friends,
                        coworkers, and the people you encounter day-to-day.

                      As the threat of the variants lingers, people travel and
                      cases continue to increase worldwide, itâ€™s important to
                      keep yourself and your loved ones safe. If youâ€™d like to
                      be tested because of symptoms, exposure, Safekey, travel
                      plans or simply for peace of mind, NMACâ€™s Covid Center
                      provides multiple convenient options. We have performed
                      thousands of COVID-19 tests since the start of the
                      pandemic.

                      Please note, if you have recently traveled back to
                      Bermuda, you can also get your testing done at our
                      NorthShore Medical Center for your convenience as opposed
                      to testing at the designated government sites. Also, see
                      our options for getting Antigen testing for your return
                      back to Bermuda.
