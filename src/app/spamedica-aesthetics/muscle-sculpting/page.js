                  M-SCULPT is ideal for anyone looking to build muscle and
                  reduce fat to get defined arms, abs or butt lift who can not
                  spend long hours in the gym daily. Even daily gym goers can
                  not achieve the same results we can in only 2 weeks having
                  treatments twice a week, total 4 sessions with our 20,000
                  muscle contractions in only 30 minutes. Who can do 20,000
                  squats in 30 minutes to get the same results that M-Sculpt
                  does? Nobody can, this is while M-Sculpt is ideal to conserve
                  time and energy for the desired results.

                        This treatment simply feels like an intense workout of
                        muscles in the area being treated. Your Specialist can
                        adjust the levels based on client feedback. You can lay
                        down and relax or even talk and watch TV during our
                        M-SCULPT treatments.

                        Yes, results are felt right after the treatment, similar
                        to an intensive workout of the target area muscles, with
                        visible results seen two to four weeks after the last
                        session in the series of treatments. The underlying
                        muscles require time to adapt and strengthen. Visible
                        results continue to improve for weeks to months after
                        the treatment series.

                        During your consultation, one of our specialists will
                        provide answers regarding how many treatments you may
                        need to achieve your goals in the treated area, as the
                        number of treatments required is dependent on your
                        desired results. One series of treatment will increase
                        muscle up to 16% and reduce fat by up to 19% in the
                        treated area. Many people are pleased with the results
                        of just one series of treatment.

                        there is no preparation needed, remember this is
                        non-surgical and non-invasive, and there is no downtime.
                        Work and normal physical activities can be resumed
                        immediately after your treatment. So if you want to come
