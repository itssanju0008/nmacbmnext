                  and body hair. The secret lies in the light-based technology

                  growth without harming surrounding skin. It's a simple
                  approach to permanent hair reduction that's fast, easy and

                    Several treatment sessions are recommended for the best aesthetic outcome. Permanent hair reduction technology can only affect hair in active phases of growth so several treatments are needed to affect all your unwanted hair. You do not need to let hair grow out between treatment sessions.

                    Typically, most people experience a mild, sunburn-like sensation, possibly accompanied by some minor swelling, immediately following the treatment. This usually lasts two to 24 hours. Ask your provider to discuss other possible side effects and the necessary post-treatment care with you.
