                Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) works on the simple basis of utilizing your own natural platelets to instruct the body to create new collagen for tauter, smoother and better-toned skin. It is a simple in-office nonsurgical procedure which uses a concentrated serum processed from your own blood in conjunction with dermal filler to increase the effectiveness and longevity of those fillers.

                <p>
                A small vial of blood is taken from your arm – less than that normally taken for routine blood tests. The blood is then placed in a vial and spun in a centrifuge to separate the red blood cells and plasma. The process concentrates the platelet count to about 4X normal. It is this platelet-rich plasma – often called "liquid gold" – that is then activated and injected into the skin.

                The Vampire Facial® is a very simple yet incredibly effective strategy for rejuvenating the skin. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) derived from your own blood is applied and worked into the skin with a professional micro-needling device. The micro-needles create tiny punctures in the skin, thus activating the collagen and elastin cascades to create new cells and rejuvenation. The PRP is added topically to stimulate new blood vessels, collagen, and elastin, thus accelerating and enhancing rejuvenation and regeneration. Adding PRP to the effective micro-needling procedure creates an unmistakable glowing skin.

                The Vampire Facial® is excellent for those suffering from Rosacea, acne, sensitive skin, scarring, sun damage or simply desire to maintain beautiful skin. The healing and anti-inflammatory effects of PRP work to correct skin problems and to strengthen the integrity of the skin to prevent future skin problems.

                  The initial injection of hyaluronic acid fillers is done skillfully to create a more youthful shape. Once the desired shape is accomplished, PRP is injected strategically to fuel the rejuvenation process. PRP ultimately contributes to the appearance of a younger version of you, with improved skin quality, color and texture. With the Vampire Facelift®, you can achieve a youthful and natural look without surgery and with minimal downtime.
