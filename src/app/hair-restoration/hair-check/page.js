                  Your HairNumberSM, also known as your Hair Mass Index (HMI),
                  is a single number that precisely and conveniently combines
                  hair density and hair caliber for quick, non-invasive method
                  tracking of hair loss or hair regrowth. Just like stepping on
                  a scale or monitoring your blood pressure, your HairNumberSM
                  is a sign of your hair's health.

                    By the time you notice hair loss with the naked eye, 50% of
                    your hair may already be gone. If you are concerned about
                    hair thinning, your HairNumber can help you easily and
                    accurately track your condition and response to treatment.

                    A decreasing HairNumber may reflect a decrease in the
                    quality or quantity of hair in that area of scalp as a
                    result of many factors: heredity, nutrition/diet,
                    medications, stress, hair styling, illness, etc. A Hair
                    Coach Physician like Dr. Brown can help you determine the
                    cause of your hair loss and prescribe effective treatments.

                    An increasing HairNumberSM may indicate an improvement in

                  There are many ways to improve the thickness, fullness and density of your hair ranging like nutritionals, phototherapy, medications and procedures. A hair coach physician, like Dr. Brown can help you design a results oriented treatment plan to help you reach your hair restoration goals.

                  Because hair loss/hair regrowth changes can take months, HairNumberSM measurements are normally performed every 3 months. In some cases, monitoring may be done more or less frequently.

                  A tiny area of scalp to be monitored is marked with four tiny, washable dots of ink. The hair within that square is carefully isolated and gathered in a bundle, which is then measured using a calibrated HairCheckTN device. More than one area may be measured to compare 'stable' areas to areas of thinning. Think of it like a tiny, scientifically-measured ponytail!
