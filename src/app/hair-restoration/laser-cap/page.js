                  LaserCap is a portable, hands-free, cordless and rechargeable
                  low level laser therapy device designed to deliver laser
                  therapy to the scalp in a convenient and discreet way.
                  LaserCap is a breakthrough device that may render hand-held
                  lasers obsolete.

                    Laser therapy is the use of visible wavelengths of light
                    (e.g. 'red') which have a biological effect on cells. It is
                    known that wavelenghts of light produced by the diodes of
                    the LaserCap are associated with an increase of energy
                    production within the cells and which may be the primary
                    mechanism for helping patients hair follicles produce
                    thicker, healthier looking hair.

                    that may be influenced by many factors, including heredity,
                    medications, illness, stress, nutrition, lifestyle, etc. and

                    patients have a thorough medical consultation before
                    initiating any hair restoration regimen. Baseline
                    evaluations, tracking measurements and standardized medical
                    photos are critical to provide an objective measurement of
                    your progress.

                    respond to PRP therapy. Some hair restoration physicians
                    apply PRP to the scalp for those patients who are not
                    surgical candidates every three (3) to four (4) months.
                    Other protocols will use PRP before or during surgery to

                    PRP has been used successfully in other medical and surgical
                    disciplines for many years. The decision to use PRP is a
                    personal decision and should be made after careful research,
                    consideration and consultation with a physician. PRP is safe
                    and natural because the procedure concentrates the good
                    cells from your own body directly back into the area where
                    it is needed. There is absolutely no chance of getting a
                    blood infection from another human being. PRP involves using
                    your own cells and it will not be rejected by your immune
                    system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Clinical trials are not complete and medical data is not yet
                    published to determine the effectiveness of PRP therapy in
                    hair restoration. PRP should not be considered a "cure" for
                    hair loss and no guarantee can be made about its individual
                    effectiveness. No claim of PRP efficacy in promoting hair
                    growth can be made because there is no FDA approval that
                    would allow such claims to be made.

                    Absolutely. In fact, we encourage it and prescribe PRP
                    therapy as a compliment to a nonsurgical approach for those
                    patients who are not eligible for surgery or who want to
                    delay hair restoration surgery. As a non-surgical treatment
                    option, we recommend PRP therapy along with Minoxidil and
                    DHT blockers or for those patients who can not tolerate or
                    have side effects with these medications.
